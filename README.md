# CI_CD_Setup
The goal of this repository is primarily to learn about modern technologies in the server/container/cloud sector.

## Critical questions
- Is it possible to create a platform independent hosting setup programmatically?
- Can the API development be simplified?
- Is a generalized way to create and communicate with containers dangerous?

## Goals
All goals are handled with minimal manual input in mind.
1. Creating a container and its contents automatically.
2. Configuring the way ( e.g. internet/local network ) a container can be accessed.
3. Communication between containers

## Special conditions
The performance aspect will be considered.
If a significant performance loss compared to monolith structures can be measured, then this project is a failure.

## Motivation
As stated above, this project is used to learn more about modern architectures and ways to structure data and functional code.
